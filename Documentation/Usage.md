# How to use in C++
To use math functions include this in your file:
```cpp
"Functions in vanilla C++";
#include "YasiuMathLib.h"

"Functions that use UE types";
#include "YasiuMathUnrealLib.h"
```

#### [List of all functions for C++](https://grzegorzkrug.github.io/UE5_YasiuMath/namespacemembers_func.html)

Functions are grouped into namespaces: [Name spaces](https://grzegorzkrug.github.io/UE5_YasiuMath/namespaces.html)

To access one of the RNG in C++, add include in your file:
```cpp
#include "SquirrelRNG.h"
/* or */
#include "PCG_RNG.h"
```
It is **UObject**, so it must comply with unreal engine rules for objects lifecycle.
Store ref value as any UObject if you want it to persist in game for longer.
```cpp
/* Declaration in class, initialize this in CDO or during gameplay */
UPROPERTY()
TObjectPtr<USquirrel13_RNG> rng;
TObjectPtr<UPCG32_RNG> rng;
```
